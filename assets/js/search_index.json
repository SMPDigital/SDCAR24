We weren't just building another EdTech company; we were on a mission to redefine the whole learning experience. We knew that technology and innovation, when used correctly, could unlock incredible potential in every student. We started out with a single school and 200 students; where we saw firsthand how the blend of technology, data, and deep understanding of how children learn could make a real difference. In just two years, the UAE Ministry of Education signed an agreement to apply the Alef Platform in ten Abu Dhabi-based public schools, who pioneered our platform. Additionally, we gleaned experience from a variety of new geographies as we enhanced our multilingual abilities and offering. These years served as a crucial proof of concept; testing our ability to roll out new products and services in a variety of languages, validating the adaptability of our platform in catering to diverse student groups, and providing rich insights into the impact of our products on student learning experience and outcomes. Following the resounding success of our platform with the early-adopter public schools, Alef Education was awarded a long-term agreement with ADEK running up to 2030 now extended up to 2033. This long-term arrangement has cemented our position as a leader in the UAE\u2019s EdTech space, and given us the perfect springboard for scale and growth at a regional and international level.

        "content": "Business case Business case Our vision for sustainable education Q&A with Alef Education\u2019s Head of Risk, Compliance, and ESG As an EdTech solutions provider partnering with governments and businesses, and crafting products and platforms used by students and educators alike; our purpose extends to creating value for all stakeholders in the learning ecosystem while transforming the future of education. Our vision for sustainability is expressed through a comprehensive ESG strategy that is directly tied to our core business. It is an integral part of how we achieve that purpose sustainably and responsibly. We have taken a holistic and collaborative approach to defining our ESG strategy , establishing a robust ESG Governance Framework , and launching a number of strategic initiatives. Having established our ESG strategy last year, we embarked on a phased approach to operationalization. In 2024, we have laid the foundation for a number of landmark projects and kick-started several key initiatives. We began by prioritising what matters to our stakeholders and our business: by looking inward and outward. We took stock of where we stood, and then envisioned where we wanted to be; in terms of creating value for our stakeholders. This involved honest conversations and in-depth consultations with experts, internal teams, partners, and customers. The process of short-listing ESG-related issues culminated in establishing a series of material topics , which have the greatest potential to impact both our company and the world around us. Then we set out clear goals as a means to not only inspire action, but also ensure we hold ourselves accountable. It's not perfect, and we're still learning, but we're committed to continuous improvement. Because at the end of the day, a sustainable future is essential to achieving our mission and building a successful business. They're not mutually exclusive; they're two sides of the same coin. Receiving Board-approval for our ESG strategy, in 2023, was just the beginning of a long-term journey. As an organisation, we are committed to continuous improvement, learning from our experiences, and setting increasingly ambitious goals. Read more Q Considering the Company\u2019s position in EdTech, what does sustainability mean for Alef Education? A Sustainability of our business is directly tied to the value we create for our stakeholders every day. It means ensuring our products, solutions, and initiatives meet their needs and expectations; while also addressing broader challenges in the education sector, the region, and across the globe. We recognise the environmental footprint inherent to a technology-driven sector; primarily in the form of energy and emissions. Our environmental efforts directly address this; by optimising our own resource-use, and also exploring green technology opportunities that would minimise our indirect environmental footprint. Equally important is our dedication to social responsibility. We are actively engaged in initiatives that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion within our organisation and beyond. By fostering a learning environment that embraces differences and empowers individuals, we aim to create positive social change that extends far beyond the boundaries of our company. On the governance front, we are committed to upholding the highest standards of integrity, ethics, and transparency. Our governance practices are designed to ensure accountability and build trust among our stakeholders. By adhering to these principles, we aim to set a benchmark for responsible corporate practices in the EdTech sector. We\u2019re in EdTech and our target market consists of students, educators, governments, and private-sector institutions. They care about the learning and teaching experience; its quality, relevance, effectiveness, and at the end of the day \u2013 educational outcomes. We serve customers across multiple geographies and employ teams in different countries. Since listing on the Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange, we are backed by a number of institutional and retail investors. Functioning at the forefront of the technology and education sectors; we are accountable to industry-specific and country-based regulatory bodies. These stakeholders expect credibility, trustworthiness, and reliability; they look to us to uphold ethical practices; and be transparent and accountable in our business dealings. We place paramount emphasis on stakeholder engagement as a cornerstone of our operational strategy. Recognising the multifaceted nature of our impact, we actively engage with our stakeholders to build meaningful relationships that extend beyond the confines of our organisational structure. By seeking their input and feedback, we ensure our solutions are not only innovative but also align with their needs and perspectives. Read more Q How are you using EdTech, and Alef Education\u2019s products in particular, to address challenges facing the education sector, especially in the UAE? One of the big challenges facing educators: How do you deliver relevant curriculum, at scale, in a rapidly evolving knowledge-landscape \u2013 in order to prepare students for tomorrow\u2019s economy? Things like digital transactions, Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML); these fields are developing rapidly \u2013 with possibilities changing almost month to month. As schools, and students, adopt technology into the structure of teaching and learning, it empowers development of crucial soft-skills, critical-thinking, and encourages exploration; all of which equip them for future careers. In addition, the content on our platform incorporates real-world examples and application from emerging fields; thereby introducing students to new concepts and future-fields. Beyond the classroom, we work with leading institutions and government partners to deploy targeted initiatives, such as Alef Education\u2019s Coding 101 program, or support wider projects such as the UAE AI Summer Camp. These and other initiatives have been made available to students across the UAE to provide early opportunities for skill development and ignite interest in tech-related careers. The digital divide is another challenge facing the education sector, across the globe and even in the UAE. While the pandemic sped up digital adoption in many countries, it has also widened the digital divide: adding a new dimension to accessibility of education, which was already a significant barrier in many parts of the world. We also take a multi-layered approach to enhancing accessibility that begins very early on. Inclusive platform design begins at conceptualization: maximising compatibility and testing and refining UI/UX to cater to a variety of learning styles. We also adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) that ensure content is more accessible to a broader range of learners, with accommodations for those who need additional support. Our platforms meet the WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria to provide the best possible experience for as many users as possible. When it comes to content: we incorporate a number of features like focused lessons to support critical skills, text and visuals that work together to support comprehension, simple, relatable contexts, and effective modeling to guide information processing. At point of delivery, we empower schools throughout the adoption process \u2013 providing teacher training, professional development, configuration assistance, and support to develop and implement accessibility strategies that ensure all students, regardless of background or location, stand to benefit. Read more A We are continuously working with government, business partners, technology providers, and schools: to address accessibility challenges, introduce and deliver accessible and relevant content, support digital transformation ambitions, enable integration of technology in classrooms, and empower educators to better use EdTech for teaching and administration. Our social initiatives endeavor to go further: addressing accessibility challenges head-on by supporting access for underprivileged students and underserved communities. Q What are some of the ways Alef Education is leveraging EdTech for good \u2013 to address global challenges? A As an EdTech player, we have a unique opportunity to equip youth with the knowledge and tools they need to navigate and respond to climate change: arguably the greatest global challenge facing our planet today. The climate education content we produce, and the groundbreaking partnerships we\u2019re forging, are doing just that. In 2024 we signed an MoU with the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD) and UNICEF; to integrate climate change education into the curriculum in public schools across Kenya. We also joined other ICESCO member states, at COP29, to engage in conversations about empowering girls through climate action . Similarly, the Alef EcoChamps program, conducted alongside COP28 last year, reached students nationwide to raise awareness, attention, and responsibility about climate change. The impending climate crisis threatens communities, ecosystems, and countries around the world. It demands a global response. We believe that raising awareness and inspiring action, through climate education, can be a critical weapon in our arsenal to combat climate change. As a pioneer in the EdTech sector, we integrate sustainability perspectives into all our products and services, and constantly look for ways to bring this thinking into every aspect of the education process. We're also using our expertise to create accessible and scalable solutions for climate education. We collaborate with reputed organisations to create engaging and interactive learning experiences that are founded on scientific findings and rooted in real-world lessons. The Alef Platform, and other digital education frameworks, can bring recognised and well-crafted climate education content to students in even the most remote areas. Partnering with the private sector, governments, and non-government actors, is critical to advancing our vision. These collaborations allow us to pool resources, share expertise, and implement innovative educational solutions; ensuring critical issues like climate change receive the attention they deserve. For example, we played a key role in developing the Educators\u2019 Voice initiative launched by the Ministry of Education: a platform that recognised the efforts of educators to promote climate awareness and integrate climate change issues into the core-curriculum. Read more Q What are you doing to build trust with your customers, when considering how data security and privacy have emerged as major concerns for users of digital platforms and emerging technologies? A We prioritise data security and data privacy at every level, following industry-leading standards and guidelines, and ensuring strict compliance with all related regulations. Our ISO 27001 certification for Information Security Management is testament to the systematic approach, robust security measures, and advanced encryption protocols we employ. We are fully compliant with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the U.S., and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is considered the gold standard in data protection. We also adhere to requisite data classification and protection measures, including those requiring localising to relevant cloud data center regions. Guided by a detailed Information Risk Management Policy that informs our risk assessment and mitigation strategies, we ensure secure storage of data in the cloud, have stringent access controls and detailed network and endpoint policies, and conduct continuous awareness programme for employees to maintain the highest levels of cybersecurity. To further strengthen our data security management system, we have established a three-year roadmap encompassing six security pillars: Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC), Identity and Access Management (IAM), Application Security, Infrastructure Security, Security Operations Centers (SOC), and Data Protection. Within the context of Data Protection, we implement a number of safeguards aligned with international guidelines. We also utilise advanced encryption methods to protect user data in transit and at rest; ensuring sensitive information remains confidential and protected from unauthorised access. As part of our cybersecurity protocol, we conduct regular security audits and penetration testing; which allow for identification and prompt remediation of any vulnerabilities. In addition, managed security services and a robust incident management system aim to uphold security standards across the board while providing required support to our customers. In addition, we work to educate the users of our platforms and products \u2013 parents, teachers, and students; by promoting best-practices and raising awareness on cybersecurity.

        "content": "Investment thesis Investment thesis Our strategy for growth The world of EdTech is moving fast. Our strategic roadmap for growth aims to position Alef Education amongst the world leaders at the forefront of this exciting sector: benefiting from, and actively driving its evolution. We have established a well-defined strategy that leverages our dominant market position in the UAE, launches expansion through entry into key markets, fuels growth through innovation, and sets us up to scale rapidly through strategic partnerships. Super-serve the UAE Replicating the proven success story with ADEK to expand our presence in the growing UAE market As the first pillar of our multi-tiered growth strategy, we rolled out a strategy to super-serve the UAE education sector\u2019s public (via B2G) and private (via B2B) segments. In the B2G segment; having already achieved full coverage of public-school grades 5-12, we aim to extend our solutions to younger grades (K-4) and to introduce new modules, subjects, and approved assessments. Our focus with B2B in the UAE caters to private schools where we currently reach approximately 40-50% of the market with a limited range of subjects. To solidify our presence in the sector and expand our market share, we have plans in place to launch into new schools, introduce a wider range of subjects, improve revenue margins, and cater to a broader age-group of students. All while delivering educators and administrators with excellent customer satisfaction. Read more The UAE market In the UAE, over a million children stand to benefit from improvements in Early Childhood Education (ECE). One third of K-12 students experience \u201clearning poverty,\u201d and the UAE\u2019s performance lags in international assessments such as PISA, TIMSS, PIRLS. Where we are today The UAE remains a key strategic market, representing a significant portion of our recognised and recurring revenue through partnerships with government, semi-government, and commercial entities. Our projects in the UAE are characterised by large scale, high customisation, and long timelines. The launch of Miqyas Al Dhad, through a joint venture with MetaMetrics, strengthened our position as a leading EdTech provider, while our extended partnership with ADEK reaffirms commitment to serving the UAE. Progress made in 2024 Our strategic long-term contract with ADEK was extended by an additional three years \u2013 till the end of trimester 1 AY 2033/34. Partnerships with private schools grew from 82 in 2023, up to 167 in 2024, reflecting 100% increase year over year Value (TCV) of contracts awarded during the year (AED 40 Mn.) Projected Value (TCV) of proposals and negotiations underway (AED 48 Mn.) Where we want to be Extend our presence amongst private schools; deepen our engagement with existing partnered public and private schools \u2013 through additional subjects, assessments, and teacher development; and widen our reach by incorporating products and offering for Early Childhood Education (ECE). Public schools (B2G) 0 + schools (100% of target market) 5-12 grades served 0 ,000+ students Private schools (B2B) 0 + schools 0 ,000+ students High impact B2G Tailored end-to-end programs to transform education outcomes for governments globally. Our B2G growth strategy contemplates active pursuit of new B2G partnerships to boost our revenue: focusing on large, long-term contracts with governments and education ministries. Ongoing discussions with potential partners in our target geographies promises a healthy pipeline of opportunities in the UAE, MENA, and further afield. The focus is on markets with K-12 systems that are largely government-run, with centralized decision-making that allows for durable, long-term, B2G contracts. B2G remains a crucial channel in our target geographies, where digital adoption is rising: especially in digitally advanced nations, where digital transformation in the education sector is driven by government reforms and a shift from print to digital.

Launched in 2024 as a joint venture with MetaMetrics\u00ae, this promising new endeavor is set to redefine Arabic language teaching, learning, and literacy by exploring innovative strategies and state-of-the-art methodologies. Where we want to be We are focused on achieving significant growth in the B2G segments, in the medium term, driven by newly secured contracts and bourgeoning opportunities in the pipeline. Strategically, we will look to onboard additional clients, schools, and students; while maintaining strength of service for existing contracts that generate stable returns. We would endeavor to maintain a sustainable revenue-mix: achieved through contribution of our Education Solutions and Support Services within the B2G contracted growth module. Among B2B world leaders Integrated platform of teaching and learning solutions empowering schools to improve educational outcomes. The final key growth strategy pillar centers on the Group expanding into the wider B2B market to unlock additional growth opportunities and further strengthen its potential to become a global leader in EdTech. Our target geographies are seeing increased investment in learning materials and EdTech solutions, with opportunities to succeed for companies that can differentiate themselves through value, usability, and advanced capabilities. UAE Market The UAE EdTech market presents a significant opportunity for our products and solutions catering to the K-12 and pre-primary segments. Our strategy prioritises high market penetration in the UAE; leveraging our readily available core content, competitive pricing structure, and expansive client-base. With a strong product pipeline in place to provide students with multiple modules per product-line, we expect growth that reflects the market's high-expendable nature. Other GCC and MENA markets The MENA region\u2019s EdTech market, offers a compelling landscape for commercial providers; mirroring trends seen in the US and Europe. The region presents significant opportunities within the K-12 and pre-primary segments, as identified through comprehensive market studies. Our target markets are seeing growing private school enrollment; with international private schools, characterized by high digital adoption and spending, representing a rapidly expanding segment. Our strategy focuses on achieving stable market-share growth by leveraging our core platform, adaptable assessments, and supplementary products; building on easier adaptability of content. Our efforts center on providing multiple modules per student; aligned with regional curricula pricing structures. Emerging markets Recognizing the vast potential of emerging markets, our strategy sets out a course for expansion into these regions. With large student populations and increasing digital adoption, these geographies present significant opportunities across a number of segments. Our strategy targets a market-share for lean growth in specific countries, which align closely with the adaptability of our product lines. A phased approach that prioritizes gradual adoption over a longer horizon, alongside our maturing product lines and service capabilities, would ensure we remain competitive even in markets with high competition and lower spending capacity. Where we are today Operating on a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model, we currently cater to private education groups, generating stable recurring revenues from a growing client base. Traction in the US market, while at a nascent stage, has demonstrated our ability to scale internationally. Progress made in 2024 Established a strong foothold for growth in KSA and Egypt with a newly hired team. This is a strong initial endeavor that enhances growth prospects within these key markets. During the year we secured our first deal in KSA, conducted launch seminars, and successfully defined product requirements for the local context; setting the stage with projections of registering over 56,000 students from 150+ private schools within the next few years. Where we want to be Gathering momentum through revenue build-up from a wide cross-section of products, including ECE, G3-12 courseware, assessment for K-12, and future learners and teacher support. Continual expansion within this space by offering more subjects and content areas, as well as catering to a wider range of age groups. Alongside the Company\u2019s first and second growth pillars, which would have a multiplier effect, a broader B2B growth strategy would deepen our presence in a range of growth markets and horizons. This, in turn, would create opportunities to accelerate growth and market-share capture through multiple channels, geographies, and product categories."

        "content": "Investment thesis Investment thesis Future-growth enablers Q&A with the Chief Product Officer For our team at Alef Education, growth in target markets hinges on a multifaceted approach. We believe that innovation-led product development, fueled by continuous iteration, is one of the most significant enablers that will accelerate scale, enhance visibility, expand reach, and solidify our leadership position in the EdTech landscape. Q How does your product development align with future trends, while also directly addressing current market demands and needs of stakeholders (students, teachers, parents, and education administrators)? A In today\u2019s intensely competitive educational landscape, where educational outcomes and accessibility are paramount, personalized learning is a necessity. Teachers and educators are increasingly requesting content delivery, assessment, and analytics components \u2013 delivered as one get-go. This is a trend in the EdTech market as well where we see different verticals, and companies, merging to deliver comprehensive educational offerings. Similarly, governments looking to transform their education systems through digitalization, are looking for solutions with proven results, interoperability with existing systems, broad deployment capabilities, and actionable data-driven insights. These are considerations we\u2019ve baked-in as part of our strategy: delivering a holistic education system with a suite of primary products , anchored to a core curriculum and assessment framework, backed by robust analytics. Personalized learning is central to our mission, and our process to realise this mission is heavily driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is already ingrained into the DNA of our platform and products. We use GenAI to enhance content delivery and learning outcomes, and employ sophisticated algorithms and machine learning to create personalised learning pathways tailored to each student's pace and style. The Alef Education AI Tutor is just one such application that is serving the right content, at the right time, and the right place. Read more Building on this strong foundation, we use a multifaceted approach to stay closely aligned with market and stakeholder needs: prioritising, tracking, and improving customer experience, customer satisfaction, and key service delivery metrics; while continually gathering and incorporating feedback into our product development process. We gather and incorporate user-feedback throughout the product development lifecycle: from initial ideation to post-launch, using a variety of mechanisms. We conduct surveys, analyse platform usage data, and track public ratings to identify trends and measure our performance. Qualitatively, we leverage built-in platform feedback channels, conduct focus-groups, and collaborate with our customers to gather direct user input. This feedback, even when it challenges our existing roadmap, is carefully assessed to inform product development decisions. Considering interoperability \u2013 Our platform is designed to integrate seamlessly with school LMSs and Information Systems; adapting to the varying technological infrastructure of different schools. Our strategic partnerships with Amazon Web Services (AWS) \u2013 for delivery , and Microsoft \u2013 for AI , further enhance our capabilities and enable us to deliver cutting-edge technology, at scale, while maintaining ease-of-use. Read more Q What are your strategies and considerations in developing new products and features? How do they address key gaps or unmet market-needs? A When thinking of new products, we always start with the problem that we are trying to solve. We ask ourselves: Will this genuinely make learning better for students? This might mean building something completely new; other times, it might involve integrating proven technologies or ecosystems. Ultimately, it's about choosing what is best for our learners and customers in order to create a friction-free experience, while enabling Alef Education to scale. Q Can you describe the product-development culture at Alef Education, and how it supports or encourages innovation? A At Alef Education, we work directly with students, teachers, schools, and parents to drive the development of the platform. We collect insights from our end-user through qualitative means i.e.: survey, focus groups, etc., as well as quantitative means such as data insights and trends. All those insights form the basis of our development, which is supported by a business case to sustain the product development life cycle. At Alef Education, we have adopted an agile model for product development that is based on rapid delivery and experimentation to fine-tune our end product. Q How does your product pipeline balance short-term needs against long-term strategic initiatives? A In 2024 we targeted and achieved the full release of seven products. Four core modules as part of the Alef Pathways platform \u2013 for Math, Science, English, and Arabic reading. And three within assessments: bringing carefully crafted products for Math, Science, English, and Arabic \u2013 writing, listening, reading. During the year, several of our other products also moved into the field-testing or piloting phases. At the same time, as part of Alef Education\u2019s long-term strategic initiatives for the year, we partnered with MetaMetrics\u00ae to launch Miqyas Al Dhad . This is a product specifically developed for the Arabic language, and is not only a new venture for us, but also an entirely new frontier for Arabic language teaching, learning, and literacy. The key is finding the right balance. We regularly review our product roadmap as part of a continuous and engaged process between Alef Education\u2019s leadership team, our key clients, and our product teams. We also prioritize our resource allocation based on stringent criteria: to ensure we\u2019re pursuing development that has marketable potential, while retaining the flexibility and leeway required to pursue emerging opportunities \u2013 something crucial if we want to stay ahead in the EdTech space.

Conflict of interest To ensure our highest governing body acts in the best interests of the Company, and continues to uphold stakeholder and shareholder trust, Alef Education employs a number of systems to identify and address any potential or actual conflicts of interest at the Board level. Full details of our governance processes, with regard to addressing conflicts of interest, are included in the Company\u2019s approved Corporate Governance (CG) manual. In addition, a Conflict-of-Interest register, maintained and updated by the Board Secretary, records all disclosed conflicts and the Board's actions therein. Training and induction Our comprehensive induction programme, coupled with ongoing training as mandated by an annual training needs-assessment, ensures Board Directors and Executive Management personnel are well-equipped to lead the Company in achieving its ambitions. The needs-assessment takes into account developmental needs and any gaps identified during board performance evaluations. At a foundational level, the Board Induction programme covers the Company's vision, mission, values, strategies, policies, and other relevant legal and financial information. Performance assessment We consider continuous evaluation to be an essential requirement for effective governance. As such, we follow a consistent process of performance evaluation to assess the functioning of our Board of Directors, Board Committees, and Executive Management. Results of an annual performance evaluation, when conducted, will be included in the Annual Corporate Governance report. To ensure objectivity, independent consultants or specialised professional entities may be called upon to conduct these evaluations. Performance assessments, when conducted, would measure key areas such as strategic alignment, competence, succession planning, regulatory compliance, risk management, executive communication, reporting, and meeting arrangements. Board function in 2024 During the year 2024, the Board focused on key areas of governance and financial oversight. This included approving audited financial statements for accuracy and transparency, ratifying the 2025 annual budget to align with strategic goals, and approving updated corporate policies and guidelines to maintain high ethical and compliance standards. Meetings and attendance As set out by the corporate governance mandates, the Board shall meet at least four times a year, with meetings conducted according to guidelines in the Company\u2019s approved governance procedures. The Board Secretary, Huda Qutishat (appointed on 3rd May 2024), functions as the rapporteur for Board of Directors\u2019 meetings.

This is why we have policies, process, and dedicated functions in place to ensure ethical decision-making, transparency, and accountability at every level of the Organisation. Remuneration and Compensation The Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC) oversees determination and review of remuneration packages for both the Board of Directors and Executive Management. The NRC ensures remuneration policies are transparent, competitive, and benchmarked against industry peers, both locally and globally. Compensation for Executive Management, similarly, is reviewed annually to ensure alignment with both Company performance and expectations, and market standards. The detailed mechanisms behind calculation of remuneration are outlined in the Alef Education Remuneration Policy. The Policy outlines compensation packages for the Board and Executive Management, detailing standards that would enable the Company to attract and retain qualified professionals to achieve its strategic goals. For the year 2024, the proposed remuneration for the Board of Directors is AED 3,000,000 (to be approved at the Annual General Meeting). There are no bonus or allowances paid/proposed for Board Members other than the above remuneration.

It also provides for audit activities that are designed to add value and improve the Company\u2019s operations. In 2024, the Audit, Risk, and Compliance Committee (ARCC) provided oversight on internal control and risk management processes, including approval and monitoring of the Internal Audit Plan and review of audit reports and findings. The Board of Directors also reviewed and updated the Company\u2019s Fraud Risk Policy, in keeping with a broader focus on better assessing corporate risks and putting in place remediation plans for the same. Internal control framework Internal Audit The Internal Audit Department applies a risk-based approach in addition to cyclical audit coverage to identify areas to be audited annually. It carries out an annual risk assessment to develop the annual audit plan for the following year which is approved by the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee. This takes into consideration the major controls in place and their design effectiveness, including business conduct risks and processes. All recommendations and associated management actions resulting from these reviews are subject to a quarterly follow-up monitoring and reporting process to ensure the timely close-out of audit actions. The Internal Audit Department ensures compliance with the Company policy, procedures, and SCA Regulations. Risk Management Formal risk reviews are performed on a regular basis across various business units and functions, with the support and guidance of the ERM Department. The results of these reviews are used to assess the Company\u2019s risk profile and exposure, identify current and emerging risks that are critical to the Group\u2019s performance and ability to achieve its strategic objectives and develop management plans to maintain risks within acceptable levels. The outcomes of these reviews are discussed with the Audit, Risk, and Compliance Committee (ARCC) and the Board of Directors. External Audit In addition to the internal controls we employ, Alef Education recognises the critical role of external auditors in ensuring the integrity of our financial statements. The ARCC is the key governing body that recommends external auditors, who are then appointed by the General Assembly (GA). Selection is based on factors like reputation, experience, and fees. External auditors provide an opinion on financial statement fairness, verify asset ownership, assess internal controls, and report violations. There are several checks and balances in place, as mandated by the Compnay\u2019s CG manual, that ensure External Assurers maintain independence and avoid potential conflicts of interest. The ARCC is tasked with evaluating the auditor's performance on an annual basis, in consideration with inputs from the Head of Internal Audit. The appointed Auditor's term is one year, and is subject to annual renewal provided that such term does not exceed six (6) consecutive years (during which the partner in charge shall be changed after three (3) years). The External Auditor can be reappointed only after two (2) years have lapsed since the termination of its appointment. Details of the appointed External Auditor for the year 2024 are as follows: Name of the audit firm Ernst & Young \u2013 Middle East Name of the Partner Auditor Walid J. Nakfour Number of years spent as the Company\u2019s External Auditor 1 Number of years the Partner Auditor spent auditing the Company\u2019s accounts 1 Total value of audit and review fees for 2024 (in AED) AED 276,500 Total value of audit of special purpose Consolidated Financial Statements for IPO AED 120,000 Total value to provide underwriter's comfort letters for IPO AED 1,138,475 Statement of other services that an External Auditor other than the Company Auditor provided during 2024 (if any) None Employee Code of Conduct Alef Education's Code of Conduct (CoC) establishes the ethical standards expected of all employees, consultants, and representatives; and governs our commercial activities while promoting a culture of honesty and accountability. This code provides guidance on ethical risks, mechanisms for reporting misconduct, and reinforces our commitment to integrity across our operations. The Human Resources department is responsible for administering the CoC, including training and communication, and serves as the primary point of contact for ethical concerns. These training and awareness programmes complement the guidelines set out in the CoC, and serve to raise awareness, drive ethical conduct, and deter wrongdoing. Violations of the CoC may result in disciplinary action, including termination. Compliance is monitored through audits and our whistleblowing mechanism. We expect all parties involved in the Company\u2019s operations to abide by the policies and regulations, and to act in the Company\u2019s best interests. Company policies Our commitment to practicing sound corporate governance is reflected in a number of comprehensive policies that have been drafted, approved, and are implemented across our organisation.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2024 and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d). Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (\u201cISAs\u201d). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (the \u201cIESBA Code\u201d) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in the United Arab Emirates, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context. We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Revenue recognition Revenue recognition is considered to be a key area of focus given that revenue is material and an important determinant of the Group\u2019s performance and profitability. The Group recognises revenue when it transfers control of a product or service to a customer. The Group mainly provides education solutions and IT infrastructure solution which comprises of initial set-up and continuous maintenance services. Revenue from IT services is recognized over time and revenue from Education solution is recognized at a point in time (refer note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for the revenue recognition policy of the Group). During the year ended 31 December 2024, total revenue of the Group amounted to AED 759,003,628. Given the magnitude of the amount and the inherent risk associated with revenue, we consider revenue recognition to be a key audit matter. To address the above risk, we performed the following procedures among others: We performed procedures to assess whether the revenue recognition criteria adopted by the Group is appropriate and is in line with the Group\u2019s accounting policy; Assessed the compliance of such policies with the applicable International Financial Reporting Standards; Inspected the contracts with customers, on a sample basis, to test the total contract values, invoicing terms, payment terms, rate per student, and rates of other services rendered to the customers; Obtained a representative sample of transactions and tested their occurrence, accuracy and recognition, by tracing them back to supporting documents; We have performed cut off procedures, including selecting the sample of transactions before and after the year end to evaluate the recognition in the current reporting period; Performed analytical procedures, to identify inconsistencies and/or unusual movements during the year; and Assessed the adequacy of the Group\u2019s disclosure in the consolidated financial statements in connection with revenue recognition. Recognition of intangible assets The Group has significant internally-generated intangible assets \u2013 research and development expenditure, which are capitalized in accordance with IAS 38 \u201cIntangible Assets.\u201d As at 31 December 2024, the carrying value of these intangible assets amounted to AED 171.9 million. The capitalization and subsequent measurement of these assets involve significant management judgment and estimation, particularly in relation to (refer 8 to the consolidated financial statements). Determining whether the costs incurred meet the criteria for capitalization under IAS 38. Assessing the useful lives of the capitalized assets. Evaluating the recoverability of the carrying amounts, including the estimation of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates. To address the above risk, we performed the following procedures among others: We performed procedures to assess whether the intangibles recognition criteria adopted by the Group is appropriate and is in line with the Group\u2019s accounting policy. We selected a sample of capitalized costs and tested whether these costs met the criteria for capitalization under IAS 38. We assessed the nature of the costs capitalized to ensure they were directly attributable to the development of content for customers and platform. We assessed the appropriateness of management\u2019s impairment testing methodology in accordance with IAS 36 \u201cImpairment of Assets\u201d. We have evaluated the key assumptions used in the impairment models, including future cash flow projections and discount rates and performed sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of changes in key assumptions on the impairment assessment. Other information Other information consists of the information included in the Board of Directors\u2019 report, other than the consolidated financial statements and our auditor\u2019s report thereon. We obtained the Board of Directors\u2019 report prior to the date of our audit report and we expect to obtain the annual report after the date of our auditor\u2019s report. Management is responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements The management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs and in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Company\u2019s Articles of Association, Companies Regulation 2020 of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), and for such internal control as the management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the management is responsible for assessing the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Group\u2019s financial reporting process. Auditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u2019s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISA will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, action taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements the consolidated financial statements include, in all material respects, the applicable requirements of the Companies Regulations 2020 of ADGM; and the financial information included in the Directors\u2019 report is consistent with the books of account and records of the Group.

        "content": "Financial statements Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2024 1 Background Corporate information Alef Education Holding PLC (the \u201cCompany\u201d or the \u201cParent\u201d) is registered in Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) under license number 17843 as a Public Company Limited by Shares. The Company was incorporated on 15 March 2024. The registered address of the Company is External Office 2332, 23rd Floor, Sky Tower, Al Reem Island, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The Company and its subsidiary, Alef Education Consultancy LLC are collectively referred to as the Group (the \u201cGroup\u201d). The principal activities of the Group are consulting and research and development in the field of technology education, institute training and development of teachers, educational facilities management, training on the development of personal competencies, educational consultancy, administrative support training services, computer systems and software designing and information technology consultancy in the United Arab Emirates. On 28 March 2024, pursuant to the reorganisation, the shareholders established the Company as a new holding company with a share capital of AED 70,000,000 at AED 0.01 per share (note 10). The Company became the new holding company of the Group through transfer of shares of Alef Education Consultancy LLC. The shares were transferred to the new holding company for nil consideration. The reorganisation was completed on 27 March 2024 during which all the legal ownership of Alef Education Consultancy LLC was transferred to the new holding company. As the Company is not a business and the reorganisation did not result in any change of economic substance, it is not considered as a business combination as defined by IFRS 3 Business Combinations. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared to reflect that the reorganisation is in substance a continuation of Alef Education Consultancy LLC as if the Company has always owned Alef Education Consultancy LLC. The Group includes one fully owned subsidiary, Alef Education Consultancy LLC which is incorporated in the United Arab Emirates. Alef Education Consultancy LLC has a subsidiary, Arabic Scale Educational Consultancy \u2013 Sole Proprietorship LLC which is incorporated in the United Arab Emirates and its primary activities are development and innovation in computer system and program and educational consultancy. Alef Education Consultancy LLC also has a branch in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi in Abu Dhabi Creative Media Zone Authority and a branch office in Amman, Hashemite of Jordan under an establishment number # 200181807 which provides support in content designing and writing. On 12 June 2024, the Company listed 20% of its share capital on Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (\u201cADX\u201d) as part of Initial Public Offering (\u201cIPO\u201d). At 31 December 2024, the Group had an average of 404 employees (31 December 2023: 414 employees). The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issuance in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors on 13 February 2025. 2 Basis of preparation 2.1 Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\u201cIASB\u201d) and applicable provision of the Companies Regulations 2020 of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). The consolidated financial statements are prepared under the historical cost basis, except for financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss which are stated at fair value as at the reporting date. The consolidated financial statements are presented in United Arab Emirates Dirham (\u201cAED\u201d), which is the functional and presentational currency of the Group. 2.2 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has: Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee) Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control. To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: The contractual arrangement(s) with the other vote holders of the investee Rights arising from other contractual arrangements The Group\u2019s voting rights and potential voting rights The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiary to bring their accounting policies in line with the Group\u2019s accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition or incorporation, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases. The consolidated financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group, using consistent accounting policies. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity, while any resultant gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognised at fair value. 2.3 Group reorganisation and business combinations under common control In the absence of guidance in IFRS for the group reorganisation and business combinations under common control, IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors requires to use judgement in developing and applying an accounting policy that provides reliable and more relevant information. As such group reorganisation has no economic substance and is outside the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations. Business combination under common control is accounted for using the pooling of interest method as follows: assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, are reflected at their carrying amounts and no adjustments are made to reflect fair values, or recognise any new assets or liabilities, at the date of the reorganisation that would otherwise be done under the acquisition method; no goodwill is recognised as a result of the reorganisation, except to the extent that existing goodwill was previously recognised in one of the combining entities. Any difference between the consideration transferred and the equity of the entity acquired as at the date of the combination is reflected within equity; and the statement of comprehensive income reflects the results of the acquiree entity. The Group adopted an accounting policy to report the comparative information as if the Group always owned the businesses acquired under common control from the date when such businesses were part of the Group. This approach is applied consistently for all such transactions. 2.4 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for the adoption of the following new standards, interpretations and amendments effective as of 1 January 2024. The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective. Disclosures: supplier finance arrangements \u2013 Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 The amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures clarify the characteristics of supplier finance arrangements and require additional disclosure of such arrangements. The disclosure requirements in the amendments are intended to assist users of financial statements in understanding the effects of supplier finance arrangements on an entity\u2019s liabilities, cash flows and exposure to liquidity risk. Thus, the amendments had no impact on the Group\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Lease liability in a sale and leaseback \u2013 Amendments to IFRS 16 In September 2022, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 16 to specify the requirements that a seller-lessee uses in measuring the lease liability arising in a sale and leaseback transaction, to ensure the seller-lessee does not recognise any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use it retains. The amendments had no impact on the Group\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Classification of liabilities as current or non-current and non-current liabilities with covenants \u2013 Amendments to IAS 1 In January 2020 and October 2022, the IASB issued amendments to paragraphs 69 to 76 of IAS 1 to specify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. The amendments clarify: What is meant by a right to defer settlement That a right to defer must exist at the end of the reporting period That classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right That only if an embedded derivative in a convertible liability is itself an equity instrument would the terms of a liability not impact its classification In addition, a requirement has been introduced whereby an entity must disclose when a liability arising from a loan agreement is classified as non-current and the entity\u2019s right to defer settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants within twelve months. The amendments had no impact on the Group\u2019s consolidated financial statements. New and amended standards and interpretations The new and amended standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Group\u2019s consolidated financial statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these new and amended standards and interpretations, if applicable, when they become effective. Amendments to IAS 21: Lack of exchangeability IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements IFRS 19 Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures The Group does not expect that the adoption of these new and amended standards and interpretations will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 3 Material accounting policy information Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group\u2019s consolidated statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Financial assets All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace. All recognised financial assets are measured subsequently in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets Classification of financial assets Debt instruments Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are measured subsequently at amortised cost: the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Amortised cost and effective interest rate method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. For financial instruments other than purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets (i.e. assets that are credit-impaired on initial recognition), the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) excluding expected credit losses, through the expected life of the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the gross carrying amount of the debt instrument on initial recognition. For purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, a credit-adjusted effective interest rate is calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows, including expected credit losses, to the amortised cost of the debt instrument on initial recognition. The amortised cost of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance. Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method for debt instruments measured subsequently at amortised cost and at FVTOCI. For financial instruments other than purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset, except for financial assets that have subsequently become credit-impaired (see below). For financial assets that have subsequently become credit-impaired, interest income is recognised by applying effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If, in subsequent reporting periods, the credit risk on the credit-impaired financial instrument improves so that the financial asset is no longer credit-impaired, interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset. For purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, the Group recognises interest income by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset from initial recognition. The calculation does not revert to the gross basis even if the credit risk of the financial asset subsequently improves so that the financial asset is no longer credit-impaired. Interest income is recognised in consolidated statement of comprehensive income and is included in the \u201cincome \u2013 interest income from a related party\u201d line item. Dividends on these investments in equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9, unless the dividends clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Dividends are included in the \u2018Income from financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss\u2019 line item in profit or loss. Financial assets at FVTPL Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL. Specifically: Investments in equity instruments are classified as at FVTPL, unless the Group designates an equity investment that is neither held for trading nor a contingent consideration arising from a business combination as at FVTOCI on initial recognition. Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any fair value gains or losses recognised in profit or loss. Cash and cash equivalents For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in hand, bank balances and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less net of bank overdraft, if any. Impairment of financial assets The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on trade and other receivables, due from related parties and cash and cash equivalents, as well as on financial guarantee contracts. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument. The Group always recognises lifetime ECL for trade receivables and amounts due from related parties. The expected credit losses on these financial assets are estimated using a provision matrix based on the Group\u2019s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, general economic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date, including time value of money where appropriate. Lifetime ECL represents the expected credit losses that will result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. In contrast, 12-month ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date. (i) Significant increase in credit risk In assessing whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the date of initial recognition. In making this assessment, the Group considers both quantitative and qualitative information that is reasonable and supportable, including historical experience and forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or effort. For financial guarantee contracts, the date that the Group becomes a party to the irrevocable commitment is considered to be the date of initial recognition for the purposes of assessing the financial instrument for impairment. In assessing whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition of a financial guarantee contracts, the Group considers the changes in the risk that the specified debtor will default on the contract. The Group regularly monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk and revises them as appropriate to ensure that the criteria are capable of identifying significant increase in credit risk before the amount becomes past due. The Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date. A financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk if: The financial instrument has a low risk of default, The borrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term, and Adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations. (ii) Definition of default The Group employs statistical models to analyse the data collected and generate estimates of probability of default (\u201cPD\u201d) of exposures with the passage of time. This analysis includes the identification for any changes in default rates and changes in key macro-economic factors across various geographies of the Group. (iii) Credit-impaired financial assets A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes observable data about the following events: significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower; a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event (see (ii) above); the lender(s) of the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower\u2019s financial difficulty, having granted to the borrower a concession(s) that the lender(s) would not otherwise consider; it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties. (iv) Write-off policy The Group writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the counterparty is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery. (v) Measurement and recognition of expected credit losses The measurement of expected credit losses is a function of the probability of default, loss given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss if there is a default) and the exposure at default. The assessment of the probability of default and loss given default is based on historical data adjusted by forward-looking information as described above. As for the exposure at default, for financial assets, this is represented by the assets\u2019 gross carrying amount at the reporting date; for financial guarantee contracts, the exposure includes the amount drawn down as at the reporting date, together with any additional amounts expected to be drawn down in the future by default date determined based on historical trend, the Group\u2019s understanding of the specific future financing needs of the debtors, and other relevant forward-looking information. For financial assets, the expected credit loss is estimated as the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Derecognition of financial assets The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortised cost, the difference between the asset\u2019s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received, and receivable is recognised in profit or loss. Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at amortised cost. Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value except payables which are carried at amount expected to be payable. Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost. The Group\u2019s financial liabilities include lease liability and trade and other payables. Derecognition A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. Property and equipment Property and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, if any. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Subsequent costs are included in the asset\u2019s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance expenses are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred. Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method on the following basis: Office equipment 3 years Office furniture and fixtures 3 years Office leasehold improvement 3 years The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. An item of property and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss. Capital work-in-progress Capital work in progress is recorded at cost and transferred to the appropriate asset category and depreciated in accordance with the Group\u2019s policies when development of a product is completed and transferred to the customers or ready for use after inspection from both parties. Leases The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases. The Group recognized lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. (i) Right-of-use assets The Group recognized right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred and lease payments made at or before the commencement date. Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of the lease term and the useful life of the underlying asset. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. (ii) Lease liabilities At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognized lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset. (iii) Short-term leases The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of property (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months). Lease payments on short-term leases recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period, with effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Computer software Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of three years. Internally-generated intangible assets \u2013 research and development expenditure Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the year in which it is incurred. An internally-generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project) is recognised if, and only if, all of the following have been demonstrated: the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale; the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it; the ability to use or sell the intangible asset; how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits; the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. The amount initially recognised for internally-generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no internally- generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss in the year in which it is incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, internally-generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately. Platform and content development costs The Group provide educational services through its technology platform and capitalises costs incurred to develop the platform. The Group also capitalizes the costs incurred for each content (teaching lesson and other educational product) including standard cost to reflect time and effort incurred internally developing the content and if applicable, fees incurred for content and product vendors and standard cost for external reviewers. The development costs are capitalized when the IAS 38 \u201cintangible asset\u201d criteria for recognition of development costs are met. Subsequent time and effort by the team to maintain and/or upgrade previously published content that was already capitalised in prior periods are expensed in the same period incurred. Additionally, costs for the time spent in developing mock tests and experiential digital lessons are expensed in the year they were incurred. Amortisation of intangible assets with finite lives is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows: Computer software 3 years Content 4 years Platform 10 years Employees\u2019 benefits A provision is made for the full amount of end of service benefits due to non-UAE national employees in accordance with the Group\u2019s policy, which is at least equal to the benefits payable in accordance with UAE Labour Law, for their period of service up to the end of the reporting period. The provision relating to end of service benefits is disclosed as a non-current liability. Pension contributions are made in respect of UAE national employees to the General Pension and Social Security Authority in accordance with the UAE Federal Law (9) of 2000 for Pension and Social Security. Such contributions are charged to profit or loss during the employees\u2019 period of service. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. When a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (where the effect of the time value of money is material). When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. Foreign currencies For the purpose of these consolidated financial statements, the UAE Dirhams (AED) is the functional and the presentational currency of the Group. Transactions in currencies other than UAE Dirhams are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of the reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences are recognised in statement of comprehensive income in the year in which they arise. Impairment of non-financial assets At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease. When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase. Current versus non-current classification The Group presents assets and liabilities in statement of financial position based on current/non-current classification. An asset as current when it is: Expected to be realised or intended to sell or consumed in normal operating cycle; Held primarily for the purpose of trading; Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period; or Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. All other assets are classified as non-current. A liability is current when: It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle; It is held primarily for the purpose of trading; It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. Fair value measurement The Group measures financial instruments, such as, financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss, at fair value at the reporting date. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the advantageous market to which Company has access at that date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: In the principal market for the asset or liability, In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to by the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. For financial instruments quoted in an active market fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available and represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm\u2019s length basis. For all other financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined by using appropriate valuation techniques. Valuation techniques include comparison with similar instruments for which market observable prices exist, adjusted net asset method and other relevant valuation models. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant\u2019s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 \u2013 Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 \u2013 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable Level 3 \u2013 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. Dividends The Group recognises a liability to pay a dividend when the distribution is authorised, and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Group. A distribution is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity. Revenue recognition The Group recognises revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in IFRS 15: Step 1 Identify contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement (in writing, orally or in accordance, with customary business practices) between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every contract that must be met. Step 2 Identify performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a good or service to the customer. Step 3 Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Step 4 Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the Group allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation. Step 5 Recognise revenue when (or as) the Group satisfies a performance obligation. The Group satisfies a performance obligation and recognises revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met: The Group\u2019s performance does not create an asset with an alternate use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. The Group\u2019s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced. The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group\u2019s performance as the Group performs. For performance obligations where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognised at a point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied. When the Group satisfies a performance obligation by delivering the promised services, it creates a contract based asset on the amount of consideration earned by the performance. Where the amount of consideration received from a customer exceeds the amount of revenue recognised, this gives rise to a contract liability. The Group recognises revenue from the following major sources: IT infrastructure solution which comprises of initial set-up and continuous maintenance services; and Education solutions Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Group recognises revenue when it transfers control of a product or service to a customer. The Group enters into contracts with its customers for supply of services through its resellers. The Group determined that it controls the services before they are transferred to customers, and it has the ability to direct the use of the or obtain benefits from the services. Therefore, the Group is acting as Principal in these arrangements if it has the responsibility for providing the services to the customers, it acts as the primary obligator and it bears the risk of providing the service. Education solutions This solutions fee corresponds to all the revenues received from customers for right of access to the Group\u2019s learning solution. The services rendered (including access to the Group\u2019s platform, availability of learning contents, on-site support and other ancillary services) are considered as one performance obligation as they are highly interdependent or interrelated. These obligations are fulfilled over time, that is over the academic year. IT set-up services The Group provides a combination of procurement and installation of IT equipment to be used for the provision of its education system solutions to schools and students. The revenue is recognised at a point in time once the goods and services are delivered/rendered to the customers. IT Maintenance services This service relates to maintenance work that may be required to be carried out on IT equipment for the duration of the contract which generally covers a period of five years. The maintenance service is considered to be a distinct service as it is available for customers from other providers in the market. Revenue relating to the maintenance services is recognised over time. The transaction price allocated to these services is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of service. Interest income Interest income is accrued on a timely basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable. Taxes Income tax Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income. Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associate, and interests in joint arrangements, when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except: When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint arrangements, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that date, are recognised subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances change. The adjustment is either treated as a reduction in goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the measurement period or recognised in profit or loss. The Group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered. Value added tax (VAT) Expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of VAT, except: When VAT incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, VAT is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable. When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of VAT included. The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the consolidated statement of financial position. 4 Significant accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in compliance with IFRS requires the management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. Future events may occur which will cause the assumptions used in arriving at the estimates to change. The effects of any change in estimates are reflected in the consolidated financial statements as they become reasonably determinable. Judgments and estimates are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Significant judgements Determining whether unsigned (oral) agreements meet the definition of contract under IFRS 15 Certain contracts for the Government of Abu Dhabi, its departments or related parties, are executed on the basis of orally agreed terms (including estimates of total contract cost and timelines) in line with the Group\u2019s historical business practice. Management has determined such unsigned oral agreements meet the definition of a \u2018contract with customer\u2019 under IFRS 15 since the Group and the customer agree upon the essential elements of a contract and any other lawful conditions, though matters of detail are left to be agreed upon at a later date, and the contract is deemed to be made and binding even in the absence of agreement on these matter of detail. In addition, under Article 132 of the UAE Civil code and under the Supreme Administrative Court Ruling in Case no. 134 of 42 Judicial Year dated 22 July 1997, a contract can be oral or written, and a contract can also result from acts which demonstrate the presence of mutual consent between the relevant parties. At year ended 31 December 2024, the balance due on oral agreement was AED 314.5 million (31 December 2023: AED 128.5 million). Capitalisation of development costs Product development assets represent direct costs incurred in the development of platform and content prior to their publication. These costs are recognised as intangible assets where the platform and content will generate probable future economic benefits and costs can be measured reliably. Content and platform are amortised upon publication of the title over estimated economic lives of four years and ten years, respectively, being an estimate of the expected operating lifecycle of the product development asset. The assessment of the useful economic life and the recoverability of product development assets involves judgement and is based on historical trends and management estimation of future potential sales. Product development assets are assessed for impairment triggers on an annual basis or when triggering events occur. The carrying amount of platform and content are set out in note 6. Source of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future and other sources of estimation uncertainty at the financial position date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. Estimating useful life for intangible assets The useful lives and residual values of the intangibles assets are based on management\u2019s judgment of the historical pattern of useful lives and the general standards in the industry. Management has reviewed the residual values and the estimated useful lives of IAS 38 \u201cIntangibles assets\u201d and has determined that these expectations do not significantly differ from previous estimates. Impairment of intangible assets The Group determines whether intangible assets are impaired when events or conditions indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In assessing whether there is any indication that the intangible assets at the end of the reporting period may be impaired, the Company considered the following: Changes in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the Company operates that had or would have an adverse effect on the Company; Plans to discontinue or restructure the operation to which the intangible assets under construction belong; and Evidence from internal reporting and external factors that indicates a potential decline in budgeted net cash flows flowing from the asset. Estimation of the recoverable amount of the intangible assets, where indicators of impairment were present, is made on the reporting date. Estimation of the recoverable amount requires a determination of the intangible assets, value in use and their fair value less costs to sell. Calculation of value in use requires the Company to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from individual cash-generating units and determination of a suitable discount rate to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Based on the review of the current market trends and economic condition, management does not anticipate any material risk on the assessment made for the risk of impairments of intangible assets. Allowance for expected credit losses on trade receivables The Group assesses the impairment of its financial assets based on the Expected Credit Loss (\u201cECL\u201d) model. Under the expected credit loss model, the Group accounts for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses at the end of each reporting period to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the financial assets. The Group measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime ECL for its financial instruments. The Group measures the expected credit losses of a financial instrument in a way that reflects: an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes; the time value of money; and reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. 5 Property and equipment Office equipment AED Office furniture and fixture AED Office leasehold improvements AED Total AED Cost At 1 January 2023 34,075,385 2,200,431 240,465 36,516,281 Additions during the year 1,135,754 27,022 \u2013 1,162,776 Disposals during the year \u2013 (22,947) \u2013 (22,947) At 31 December 2023 35,211,139 2,204,506 240,465 37,656,110 Additions during the year 1,998,599 350 \u2013 1,998,949 At 1 December 2024 37,209,738 2,204,856 240,465 39,655,059 Accumulated amortisation At 1 January 2023 29,479,077 2,156,390 231,723 31,867,190 Depreciation 3,236,462 31,950 3,450 3,271,862 Disposals \u2013 (22,947) \u2013 (22,947) At 31 December 2023 32,715,539 2,165,393 235,173 35,116,105 Depreciation 1,708,622 17,935 3,450 1,730,007 At 31 December 2024 34,424,161 2,183,328 238,623 36,846,112 Carrying amount: At 31 December 2024 2,785,577 21,528 1,842 2,808,947 At 31 December 2023 2,495,600 39,113 5,292 2,540,005 6 Intangible assets Computer software AED Platform AED Content AED Capital work-in-progress AED Total AED Cost At 1 January 2023 607,676 31,046,714 143,690,960 2,452,943 177,798,293 Additions during the year \u2013 9,656,122 17,631,849 8,557,729 35,845,700 Transfers \u2013 \u2013 2,452,943 (2,452,943) \u2013 At 31 December 2023 607,676 40,702,836 163,775,752 8,557,729 213,643,993 Additions during the year \u2013 46,476,190 \u2013 77,053,860 123,530,050 Transfer 57,346,435 9,110,262 (66,456,697) \u2013 At 31 December 2024 607,676 144,525,461 172,886,014 19,154,892 337,174,043 Accumulated amortisation At 1 January 2023 607,676 15,076,501 87,328,570 \u2013 103,012,747 Amortisation \u2013 2,913,267 27,819,627 \u2013 30,732,894 At 31 December 2023 607,676 17,989,768 115,148,197 \u2013 133,745,641 Amortisation \u2013 8,172,385 23,326,893 \u2013 31,499,278 At 31 December 2024 607,676 26,162,153 138,475,090 \u2013 165,244,919 Carrying amount: At 31 December 2024 \u2013 118,363,308 34,410,924 19,154,892 171,929,124 At 31 December 2023 \u2013 22,713,068 48,627,555 8,557,729 79,898,352 Capital work-in-progress represents costs of third-party vendors and in-house staff for the development of platform which is not yet completed at the reporting date and will be completed within a year of the reporting date. *Included in additions during the year ended 31 December 2024 is the acquisition of education products called Arabits from SAAL Operating Systems \u2013 Sole Proprietorship L.L.C., a related party for an amount of AED 35.3 million (note 14). Included in additions during the year ended 31 December 2024 is the acquisition of an education product called Abjadiyat for a total amount of AED 11.2 million. On 29 March 2024, the Group signed a partnership agreement with a US-based developer, MetaMetrics\u00ae to develop an Arabic reading scale to improve the literacy skills of K-12 Arabic speakers in collaboration with 6 Arab speaking countries. The newly developed Arabic scale is being branded as \u201cMiqyas Al-Dhad Scale\u201d. Included in additions during the year ended 31 December 2024 is an amount of AED 8.9 million incurred towards its ongoing development. Additions during the year ended 31 December 2024 also include AED 68.1 million representing the development of new content, products around assessments and pathways product lines. These include pathways products for Math, English, Arabic and Science along with an assessment solution. Moreover, the Group is supporting growth through internationalization and other key features. 7 Leases The Group has rented office premises in United Arab Emirates (UAE) for its head office and in Amman, Hashemite of Jordan Set out below are the carrying amounts of the Group\u2019s right-of-use asset and lease liability and the movements during the year: Right-of-use assets 31 December 2024 AED 31 December 2023 AED At the beginning of the year 480,533 \u2013 Additions during the year 8,216,840 691,897 Depreciation expense (2,542,969) (211,364) At the end of the year 6,154,404 480,533 Lease liability 31 December 2024 AED 31 December 2023 AED At the beginning of the year 471,021 \u2013 Additions during the year 8,216,840 691,897 Payments during the year (2,699,232) (258,931) Interest expense 382,143 38,055 At the end of the year 6,370,772 471,021 * During the year ended 31 December 2024, the Group reassessed the lease classification of its head office in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in accordance with IFRS 16 \u2013 Leases. Due to management\u2019s discretion to extend the lease beyond 12 months, the lease was reclassified from an operating lease to a finance lease. Consequently, the Group recognized a right-of-use asset of AED 8,216,840, with a corresponding lease liability recorded under current and non-current liabilities. Following this modification, the Group started recognizing depreciation on the right-of-use asset and finance costs on the lease liability under \u201clease expenses\u201d. The lease liabilities are classified in the consolidated statement of financial position as follows: 31 December 2024 AED 31 December 2023 AED Current 3,198,736 229,056 Non-current 3,172,036 241,965 Total 6,370,772 471,021 Amounts recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income relating to lease expenses: 31 December 2024 AED 31 December 2023 AED Interest expenses 382,143 38,055 Depreciation on right-of-use asset 2,542,969 211,364 Expenses relating to short-term leases 1,007,450 3,281,545 Total lease expenses 3,932,562 3,530,964 8 Trade and other receivables 31 December 2024 AED 31 December 2023 AED Trade receivables 318,490,318 133,752,712 Prepayments 10,568,774 11,913,674 Accrued income 9,353,457 8,339,893 Advances 1,936,274 3,497,603 Refundable deposits 5,200,932 9,869,061 Total 345,549,755 167,372,943 Current 340,607,163 154,947,624 Non-current* 4,942,592 12,425,319 Total 345,549,755 167,372,943 * Represents long-term margin deposits against bank guarantees issued to a customer and non-current portion of prepaid expenses. Included in the trade receivable balance are balances totalling AED 317,451,530 (31 December 2023: AED 132,523,295) due from mainly three government customers in the United Arab Emirates, arising in the normal course of operations. Based on past experience of the Group, these balances are settled regularly and there is no history of significant write-off of receivables. Management considers that this concentration of credit risk will not result in any significant loss to the Group. The ageing analysis of the trade receivables is as follows: Total AED Neither past due nor impaired AED 0-30 days AED 31-60 days AED 61-90 days AED 91-120 days AED Above 120 days AED At 31 December 2024 318,490,318 4,769,322 91,109,196 33,277,239 7,716,339 105,962 181,512,260 At 31 December 2023 133,752,712 3,637,285 90,471,090 674,997 33,871,137 5,098,203 \u2013 For trade receivables, the Group has applied the simplified approach in IFRS 9 to measure the loss allowance at lifetime ECL. The Group determines the expected credit losses on these items by using a provision matrix, estimated based on historical credit loss experience based on the past due status of the debtors, adjusted as appropriate to reflect current conditions and estimates of future economic conditions. Accordingly, the credit risk profile of these assets is presented based on their past due status in terms of the provision matrix. No provision for expected credit losses was recorded for trade receivables at 31 December 2024 (31 December 2023: nil). 9 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the financial year as shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows comprise of: 31 December 2024 AED 31 December 2023 AED Cash on hand 16,645 6,606 Cash at bank 396,282,513 261,767,109 Cash and cash equivalents 396,299,158 261,773,715 Included in cash at bank are bank deposits with an original maturity of less than 3 months of AED 365,000,000 (31 December 2023: AED 78,501). These are denominated in UAE Dirham and carry interest at market rates. 10 Share capital The shareholders of the Company and the respective ownership interests is as follows: 31 December 2024 AED 31 December 2023 AED Authorised, issued and fully paid 31 December 2024:7,000,000,000 shares of AED 0.01 each (US$ 0.0027) 70,000,000 \u2013 The share capital of the Company was funded by transferring AED 70,000,000 from the retained earnings. Moreover, the legal formalities with the ADGM were completed on 15 March 2024, and the ADGM issued a Certificate of Incumbency and Business Extract with an amount of USD 19,060,585 (equivalent to AED 70,000,000), divided into 7,000,000,000 (seven billion) ordinary shares with a par value of US$ 0.0027 (equivalent to AED 0.01) as the authorised and paid up share capital of the Company. On 12 June 2024, the Company listed 1,400,000,000 (20%) of its ordinary shares on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (\u201cADX\u201d) Shareholders\u2019 contributions Shareholders\u2019 contributions are interest free and in the nature of long-term funding. The Group has no contractual obligation towards the repayment of this amount. 11 Other reserve In accordance with the UAE Federal Law No. 32 of 2021, the subsidiary is required to transfer 5%, (31 December 2023: 5%) of the profit for the year to statutory reserve, which is non-distributable. The subsidiary has discontinued such annual transfers as the reserve has reached 50% of the issued and paid-up share capital of the subsidiary. 12 Provision for employees\u2019 end of service benefits 31 December 2024 AED 31 December 2023 AED At the beginning of the year 12,921,328 11,216,918 Charge for the year 4,871,160 4,286,824 Payments during the year (1,985,848) (2,582,414) At the end of the year 15,806,640 12,921,328 An actuarial valuation is not considered necessary by management in respect of employees\u2019 end of service benefits as the net impact of actuarial valuation is not considered material. 13 Trade and other payables 31 December 2024 AED 31 December 2023 AED Trade payables 6,429,987 16,649,944 Accrued expenses and other payables 41,487,642 36,689,925 Advances from customers 36,530,022 30,801,639 VAT payable 13,602,631 9,866,874 Total 98,050,282 94,008,382 14 Related parties balances and transactions The Group enters into transactions with companies and entities that fall within the definition of a related party as contained in the International Accounting Standard (IAS) 24 Related Party Disclosures.

Capital comprises share capital, shareholders\u2019 contribution, retained earnings and other reserve. The Group monitors and adjusts its capital structure with a view to promote the long-term success of the business while maintaining sustainable returns for shareholders. This is achieved through a combination of risk management actions including monitoring solvency, minimising financing costs and maintaining high standards of business conduct. At 31 December 2024, the Group is mainly funded by the shareholders and has no external debt. 18 Financial risk management The Group\u2019s principal financial liabilities comprise of lease liability, amount due to a related party and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to manage Group\u2019s cash flows and partially finance capital work-in-progress. The Group has various financial assets such as trade and other receivables, amounts due from related parties and cash and cash equivalents, which arise directly from operations. The main risk arising from Group\u2019s financial instruments are foreign currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk. Foreign currency risk The Group does not have significant exposure to foreign exchange risk as most of its monetary assets and liabilities are denominated in UAE Dirhams. The Group has a bank account in the Hashemite of Jordan which had a balance of AED 125,350 at 31 December 2024 (31 December 2023: AED 629,900) which did not have a significant exposure at year ended 31 December 2024. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group\u2019s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group\u2019s bank deposits and amounts due from related parties. If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher/lower and all other variables held constant, the Group\u2019s profit (loss) for the year ended 31 December 2024 would have increased or decreased by AED 2,707,580 (31 December 2023: AED 1,850,719). There is no direct impact on the Group\u2019s equity. Credit risk Credit risk refers the risk arising on account of a default by counterparty on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the Group annually. The Group uses its own trading records to rate its major customers. The Group is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable, bank balances and amounts due from related parties. Credit risk is limited to the carrying values of each class of financial assets in the consolidated statement of financial position. Concentration of credit risk Concentration of credit risk arises when a number of counter-parties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. Concentration of credit risk indicates the relative sensitivity of the Group\u2019s performance to developments affecting a particular industry or geographic location. Management believes that the concentration of credit risk, as detailed in Note 9, is mitigated by high credit worthiness and financial stability of its trade customers. Balances with banks are assessed to have low credit risk of default since these banks are among the major banks operating in the United Arab Emirates and Hashemite of Jordan and are highly regulated by Central Banks. Trade and other receivables, amounts due from related parties and cash and cash equivalents are not secured by any collateral. The amount that best represents maximum credit risk exposure on financial assets at the end of the reporting period, in the event counter parties fail to perform their obligations generally approximates their carrying value. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group\u2019s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group\u2019s reputation. The following tables detail the Group\u2019s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant. Total AED 0-3 month AED 3-12 month AED 1-5 years AED 31 December 2024 Lease liability 6,766,600 1,072,450 2,440,350 3,253,800 Trade payables 6,429,987 6,429,987 \u2013 \u2013 Total 26,799,218 21,105,068 2,440,350 3,253,800 31 December 2023 Lease liability 517,590 258,795 \u2013 258,795 Trade payables 16,649,944 16,649,944 \u2013 \u2013 Total 27,034,408 26,775,613 \u2013 258,795 19 Commitments and contingent liabilities 31 December 2024 AED 31 December 2023 AED Bank guarantees 16,315,667 8,580,794 Bank guarantees are issued by the bank in the normal course of the Group\u2019s business against which the Group is required to maintain security deposits of equivalent amounts. 20 Fair value of financial instruments Financial instruments comprise of financial assets and financial liabilities. Financial assets consist of bank balances, trade receivables, amounts due from related parties, financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss and some other current assets. Financial liabilities consist of trade payables, lease liabilities, amounts due from a related party and other current liabilities. The fair values of financial instruments are not materially different from their carrying values. Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of assets and liabilities by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly. Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data. There are no financial assets and/or liabilities which should be measured at fair value and accordingly no disclosure is made. 21 Reporting segments The Group is organized into business units based on its products and services for management purposes. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) for the Group and monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of decision making about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on profit or loss and is measured consistently with profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements. Based on the information reported to the Group\u2019s senior management for the allocation of resources, and measurement of performance of business, the reportable segments under IFRS 8 were identified as below: Education solution segment, which provides customers the right of access to the Group\u2019s learning platform.
