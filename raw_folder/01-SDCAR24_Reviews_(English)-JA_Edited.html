<h1>CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT</h1>
<p class="lifter">It is a great privilege to be named Chairman of SEDCO Holding’s 
  board and follow in the footsteps 
  of outgoing Chairman, Sheikh Saleh Salem BinMahfouz. </p>
	
<p class="lifter">I warmly welcome our new 
  third-generation family members to the Board of Directors, and express my immense gratitude to our board members, past and present, for their guidance and leadership. I would also like to thank the shareholders for placing their trust in me, and I am committed to honoring that trust in all my endeavors.</p>	
	
	
<p>SEDCO Holding has consistently supported national development goals while upholding the principles of sustainable investing and Shariah compliance to generate value for its shareholders. This will continue 
  to be a focal point of our strategy as we seek to support the Vision 2030 as a leading active financial investor. 
  We will continue focusing on priority sectors that bring value to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia while remaining open to new opportunities.</p>
<p>During the year, we secured approval to form a new real estate entity, which will centralize our Investment, Development, and Asset Management functions. 
  The company name is soon to be announced in 2025.</p>
<p>We also hosted our first Diwaniyat SEDCO in Riyadh and will continue to host them in 2025, a platform where economic experts and business leaders will join us in open discussion to foster meaningful networking, knowledge-sharing, and insightful discussions on the global and

  literacy across the Kingdom. </p>
<p>On behalf of our shareholders and Board of Directors, I thank the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques; King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, The Crown Prince and Prime Minister; HRH Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz and all government ministers for their counsel and guidance. I also gratefully acknowledge our executive team for their initiative and diligence as we explore new opportunities in line with our values.</p>

<h1>Chief Executive Officer’s Message</h1>
<p class="lifter">2024 was a year of refining our focus towards high-priority sectors while welcoming a new Chairman and board members.</p>
<p>This year, we warmly welcomed a new Chairman along with a fresh cycle of board members. including representatives from the third generation of our shareholding family. We look forward to their valuable insights and strategic direction as we build toward the future. We also extend our sincere gratitude to our previous board members and Chairman for their 
  capable leadership during their tenure.</p>
<p class="lifter">We actively participated in the Kingdom’s journey of development while seeking new opportunities and streamlining existing businesses.</p>	
<p>We renewed our focus on priority sectors for domestic investment aligned with opportunities presented by the Vision 2030, including healthcare, logistics, education, and hospitality. We also explored opportunities in new sectors where opportunities beckon with a view to entering new asset classes.</p>
<p>In particular, we identified areas where we could boost private sector engagement in national development, such as unlocking KSA’s potential for leisure and tourism, driving growth in real estate, developing infrastructure to support national development goals, and help localize supply chains to promote national production. In 2024, we also successfully concluded the sale of our auto leasing company AutoWorld to Budget Saudi, becoming a major shareholder in the largest auto rental and leasing company in the region. We continued to welcome the world through our hospitality brand Elaf, with The Hotel Galleria Jeddah, transitioned to a strategic partnership with Hilton becoming part of the Curio Collection Hotels 
  in March 2024.</p>
<p>I want to express our appreciation for the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud; and HRH Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, Crown Prince and Prime Minister, for their visionary leadership and strategic approach to achieving Saudi Vision 2030 goals, laying the foundations and frameworks for 
  enduring national success.</p>
<p>I also thank our team members, both in our core team and those in our partner businesses for their diligence, achievements and successes. Looking forward, 2025 promises to be an exciting year one where we have planned strategic investments in our real estate and healthcare sectors, reflecting our long-term commitment to these critical areas. We will also undertake a strategic review to reflect on our performance over recent years, aligning closely with the accelerated timelines of 
  Saudi Vision 2030 and exploring the potential impact 
  of milestones achieved ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>We remain poised to continue our trajectory towards sustainable and responsible investing, empowering our strategic portfolio of private and public Saudi businesses towards greater success.</p>
