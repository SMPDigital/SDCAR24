Impact
	<p>SEDCO contributes to 
  the Kingdom’s development 
  through strategic investments 
  in priority sectors</p>

	
	
	
	
<h1>Corporate Investment</h1>
<p>With a legacy spanning 
  nearly half a century, SEDCO has empowered local businesses and communities, propelling them toward prosperity by actively seeking investment opportunities that fuel economic growth and social development within 
  the Kingdom.</p>
<p>While prioritizing sectors such as healthcare, logistics, education, and hospitality, we embrace new sectors where strategic opportunities beckon, entering new asset classes and defining clear performance metrics for our portfolio. Growing our expertise and collaborating with key partners further allows us to navigate the evolving investment landscape with agility and consolidate our engagement with the Kingdom’s economic growth trajectory.</p>
<h2>Guided by our Core Values </h2>
<p>We prioritize long-term, responsible investments that serve the best interests of the Kingdom and our stakeholders. SEDCO’s Investment Policy Statement (IPS) serves as the cornerstone of our investment decisions: defining our investment criteria, including preferred sectors and themes, asset classes, ticket sizes, 
  expected returns, equity interests, and desired levels 
  of engagement.</p>
<p>Before entering any new investments, exhaustive due diligence, encompassing rigorous background checks, and financial, legal, and commercial assessments are conducted. The process ensures all potential investments meet our financial objectives and align with our steadfast commitment to sustainability, transparency, accountability, and ethical business practices.</p>
<p>Regular performance reviews of investments provide ongoing monitoring and scrutiny, ensuring continued compliance with regulations and adherence to our established goals and values.</p>

<h2>Financing Investment Success</h2>
<p>As an active financial investor, SEDCO relies on a robust finance function to effectively support our two investment pillars. This function ensures liquidity and facilitates timely capital deployment, critical for our investment success.</p>
<p>To enhance financing capabilities, we are developing a strategic financing plan that includes dedicated bank facilities for each portfolio and leverages current assets as collateral to optimize borrowing costs. Our dynamic liquidity management strategy optimizes cash flow, leverages liquid assets, and generates returns through Murabaha deposits and sovereign Sukuk.</p>
<p>During 2024, we expanded our investment portfolio 
  across various asset classes to enhance diversification 
  and improve liquidity. </p>
<h2>Portfolio Of Investment</h2>
<p>In 2024, SEDCO’s Corporate Investment portfolio encompassed a diverse range of sectors, company sizes, and asset classes. This included direct investments in both public and private companies, as well as indirect investments through Discretionary Portfolio Management of public equities, Shariah-compliant bonds (Sukuk), 
  and Private Equity/Venture Capital funds.</p>
<h4>To guide Corporate Investments, we have identified six key investment themes:</h4>

<h3>Direct Investments</h3>
<p>We focus on supporting a strategic mix of private and public homegrown businesses to become successful companies, contributing to the Kingdom’s economic progress. We actively pursue strategic partnerships that benefit both our portfolio and the wider community.</p>
<h3>Indirect Investments </h3>
<p>Indirect investments encompass allocations to local fund and asset managers specializing in domestic Discretionary Portfolio Management (DPM), venture capital, and private equity funds targeting sectors like IT, logistics and infrastructure. This range of Shariah-compliant instruments and asset-classes generates long-term capital growth and periodic income; while contributing to meaningful financial and social impact in the Kingdom.</p>

<h2>Corporate INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS 2024 <img src="02-SDCAR24_Reviews-2_(English)-JA_Edited-web-resources/image/7.png" alt="" /></h2>
<p>Our Corporate investment portfolio experienced 
  significant growth, driven by both new investments and steady appreciation from existing holdings. Fund deployments, aligned with our strategy, enhanced portfolio diversification throughout the year.</p>
<p><strong>Joining Forces with Budget Saudi </strong></p>
<p><img src="02-SDCAR24_Reviews-2_(English)-JA_Edited-web-resources/image/8.png" alt="" />&#9;Established in 1981, AutoWorld was one of SEDCO’s earliest businesses and a marker of our early growth. Over four decades, it evolved into a leading auto-leasing company in the Kingdom. In July 2024, we successfully concluded the sale of AutoWorld, our fully owned subsidiary, to Budget Saudi (United International Transportation Company), a leading player in the regional market. This strategic transaction, which saw SEDCO acquire an 8.96% stake in Budget Saudi, makes us a major shareholder in the largest auto rental and leasing company in the region.</p>

<p>Driving Value Through Active Partnership</p>
<p><img src="02-SDCAR24_Reviews-2_(English)-JA_Edited-web-resources/image/8.png" alt="" />&#9;SEDCO engages with portfolio companies at multiple levels, providing strategic guidance, financial oversight, and M&amp;A support; while gradually reducing operational assistance. Our primary engagement will focus on communication with leadership teams and active participation on boards and key committees, such as audit and risk, compensation and nomination, and executive committees. Board representation aligns with our ownership stake in each company.</p>
<p><img src="02-SDCAR24_Reviews-2_(English)-JA_Edited-web-resources/image/11.png" alt="" />&#9;All SEDCO investments adhere to Shariah principles. We prioritize the ESG initiatives of portfolio companies: supporting CSR activities, fostering robust governance, developing growth strategies, managing key risks, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of our investments.</p>
<p><img src="02-SDCAR24_Reviews-2_(English)-JA_Edited-web-resources/image/8.png" alt="" />&#9;In 2024, we continued expansion into new asset classes in line with the approved strategy, further diversifying our DI portfolio. We invested in our first corporate Sukuk and expanded our investments in government Sukuk to diversify our portfolio and capitalize on attractive yields.</p>

<h2>OUTLOOK FOR 2025</h2>
<p>In 2025, we will undertake a comprehensive strategic review, reflecting on our achievements over the past three years. The review will align our strategy more closely with the timeline and goals of Saudi Vision 2030, considering recent milestones such as Saudi Arabia’s confirmation as host for Expo Riyadh 2030 and the FIFA World Cup in 2034. The revised strategy will guide our future direction, including continued deployments into diverse asset 
  classes and the exploration of strategic options for 
  the corporate investment portfolio.</p>

<h1>Real Estate Group</h1>	
<p class="lifer">In 2024, SEDCO received approval to create, a new subsidiary that will oversee the three key pillars of our real estate portfolio: Investment, Development, and Asset Management. </p>
<p>Our current portfolio consists of a land bank (54%), built assets (28%), real estate private equity (15%) and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) through SEDCO’s shareholding in SEDCO Capital REIT. Within the built-assets portfolio, our hospitality sector holds a prominent position, followed by retail space, residential real estate, and other segments. Guided by a financial investor mindset, our real estate initiatives will focus on delivering strong shareholder returns.</p>
<p>[[Image]]</p>
<h2>From Strategy to Action</h2>
<p>In 2024, Real Estate Group secured approval for its FY23-27 Strategy and Business Plan to deliver a well-balanced portfolio. The strategy emphasizes sectorial and geographical diversification, with a focus on expanding into new asset classes, such as infrastructure, developing mixed-use projects on existing land bank and new acquisitions. </p>
<p>We are implementing a robust organizational framework to further empower our team to achieve the strategic objectives and deliver strong returns for our shareholders. In addition, we are exploring multiple funding sources, including the potential sale of non-core assets, to facilitate accelerated investment deployment and ensure the success of the strategic plan. </p>
<p>In 2023, our portfolio comprised 60% income-generating assets and 40% non-income generating assets. The strategic plan aims to prioritize increasing the income-generating portion to 77%, primarily through new developments and investments in high-growth sectors. Concurrently, the plan seeks to optimize existing income-generating assets by increasing NOI yields 
  from 5.0% to 6.4%.</p>
<p><img src="02-SDCAR24_Reviews-2_(English)-JA_Edited-web-resources/image/17.png" alt="" />&#9;In 2024, SEDCO achieved a 15% increase in recurring income, exceeding our budget by 5%. We divested five assets, including the successful receipt of compensation.</p>
<p>To streamline asset management and ensure VAT compliance, we introduced REIS, an in-house electronic platform, and integrated it with ZATCA.</p>

<h1>FULFILLING OUR 
  SUSTAINABILITY PROMISE</h1>	
<p>Since our formation, sustainability has been at the heart of our mission as we serve the Kingdom and create lasting impact for all our stakeholders. In alignment with Saudi Vision 2030 and the UN’s SDG goals.</p>
<p>Our Sustainability Framework, built on the three core pillars: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG), serves as a guiding lens for our business units and teams. We are committed to continuous improvement and are currently refining this framework through the development of SEDCO’s ESG strategy.</p>
<p><strong>[[Diagram]]</strong></p>
<h2>Our ESG Journey (Materiality)</h2>
<p>In recent years, our materiality assessments have informed the development of an initial ESG Framework, which has now evolved into a comprehensive strategy. This strategy is guiding the implementation of formal ESG KPIs across SEDCO’s business units. We consistently produce sustainability reports in alignment with GRI Standards, 
  and are proud to have released our second integrated report. Furthermore, we maintain our commitment to external validation by regularly renewing our private rating on the MSCI ESG Rating Index. </p>
<h2>Building Stakeholder Relationships</h2>
<p>Effective stakeholder engagement involves actively addressing the needs of each group and keeping 
  them informed about the Company’s activities. 
  This allows us to identify opportunities for 
  collaboration and meaningful interaction.

<h2>OUR GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK</h2>
<p>We are committed to upholding the highest standards 
  of corporate governance.</p>
<p>SEDCO’s corporate governance, encompassing nine key elements, is grounded in the core principles of fairness, transparency, accountability, and responsibility. </p>
<p>[[Diagram]]</p>
<p>Our commitment to these principles has earned us an exceptional track record, recognized by the Institute of Directors, which has lauded our practices as among the best in the region.</p>
<h2>Corporate Governance 
  Developments in 2024 <img src="02-SDCAR24_Reviews-2_(English)-JA_Edited-web-resources/image/7.png" alt="" /></h2>
<p>Following a specialist-led review of our Corporate Governance Manual in the previous years; we updated our Corporate Governance standards in 2024; in accordance with changes to legislation and regulation. </p>
<p><img src="02-SDCAR24_Reviews-2_(English)-JA_Edited-web-resources/image/36.png" alt="" />&#9;Amendments included implementation of the three lines of defense concept to Risk Management, and addition of further details and guidelines for addressing shareholder relationships and expectations, and establishing and operationalizing internal controls. SEDCO’s updated Corporate Governance Manual also reflects changes in the governance structure, and matters related to the Board and Board Committees. Successful implementation of the Chronograph platform, in 2024, has enabled greater automation 
  and better data analysis for decision-makers at the Board level.</p>
<p><img src="02-SDCAR24_Reviews-2_(English)-JA_Edited-web-resources/image/36.png" alt="" />&#9;In collaboration with our Internal Audit team, we developed comprehensive policies, procedures, and guidelines for key departments. Company policies and Board Committee charters were also reviewed and updated for clarity and efficiency.</p>

<p>To ensure accountability, strategic oversight, and open communication across operations, we have established specialized Board Committees that support our highest governing body in discharging their duties and responsibilities. Delegation of authority to Board Committees and other key functions is governed by a comprehensive set of policies, regularized processes, and well-established practices.</p>

<p>As part of our updated Corporate Governance Manual, we have established guidelines for Board competence, training, and assessment, which are vital for effective governance. These systems ensure board members possess the necessary skills and knowledge, maintain high performance standards, and align with evolving best practices and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Training for Board Members is tailored based on existing skills and capabilities, future needs, and expertise that Board Members would require at SEDCO’s affiliates. Additionally, we follow a standardised Board evaluation process, with routine effectiveness evaluations, which assesses the performance of the Board based on criteria outlined in the Company’s Corporate Governance Manual.</p>

<h2>Internal Audit Function</h2>
<p>SEDCO’s Internal Audit Department (IAD) is staffed by qualified professionals possessing extensive internal audit and industry experience, coupled with an in-depth understanding of risk and control processes. The team holds essential professional competencies and certifications, including Certified Internal Auditor (CIA) and Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA). These certifications necessitate ongoing Continuing Professional Education (CPE) to maintain currency with evolving industry standards and practices.</p>
<h3>IA Actions in 2024 <img src="02-SDCAR24_Reviews-2_(English)-JA_Edited-web-resources/image/53.png" alt="" /></h3>
<p><img src="02-SDCAR24_Reviews-2_(English)-JA_Edited-web-resources/image/8.png" alt="" />&#9;Introduced Global Internal Audit Standards (GIAS), and assessed gaps for implementation.</p>
<p><img src="02-SDCAR24_Reviews-2_(English)-JA_Edited-web-resources/image/8.png" alt="" />&#9;Conducted six audits, covering SEDCO and subsidiaries, and followed-up on five completed departmental audits to implement corrective action plans.</p>

<h2>Audit Cycle</h2>
<p>TeamMate+, a comprehensive audit management software, streamlines the IAD’s audit cycle. External Quality 
  Assurance (EQA) assessments, by the Institute of Internal Auditors (US IIA), are conducted every five years; 
  the most recent was in 2020.</p>
<p>[[Diagram]]</p>
<h2>ESG Governance</h2>
<p>SEDCO Holding’s ongoing review of its Corporate Governance Framework incorporates ESG factors and other material topics. These changes detail our commitments to Environmental, Social, and Governance pillars, and outline the Board and its committees’ 
  oversight of ESG matters.</p>
<p>Recognizing the pivotal role of ESG in our strategy, the Sustainability Council–comprised of SEDCO Holding members and representatives from affiliated organizations–collaborates with the Corporate Communications and Sustainability Team. This collaboration focuses on reviewing climate-related risks and opportunities, and assessing the potential ESG impacts of SEDCO Holding’s strategic roadmap. Our ESG strategy includes a continued commitment to reducing the environmental impact of our operations, particularly greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<h2>Risk Management</h2>
<p>SEDCO Holding operates in a complex and constantly evolving investment environment, where effective management of risk is a critical part of operations. We are in the process of developing a Risk Management (RM) Policy and a set of RM Procedures, which would guide our operations within approved risk tolerance levels. Plans are in place for activation of a dedicated RM function and implementation of the policy, in 2025. Development of RM Policies and Procedures are part of SEDCO’s company-wide review of policies and procedures (P&amp;P). </p>

<h2>OUR CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT</h2>
<p>SEDCO’s Code of Business Conduct is the cornerstone of our ethical culture, guiding employees at all levels in their daily operations. In 2024, SEDCO Holding conducted a training session for selected employees to enhance compliance awareness and knowledge. Our commitment to integrity and accountability is reflected in our outstanding track record, with no instances of 
  non-compliance reported during the year.</p>
<p>The Code mandates adherence to all applicable laws and regulations and addresses critical areas such as conflicts of interest, integrity, insider trading, gifts and entertainment, and anti-money laundering. It provides clear guidance on navigating ethical issues and offers confidential reporting channels for addressing unethical conduct internally. Applicable across all SEDCO activities, the Code extends to our suppliers, contractors, and consultants. An Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (AML/CTF) Policy, which includes a comprehensive screening process, is currently under development.</p>
<p>Integrated into our Corporate Governance framework and Human Resources policies, the Code is reinforced by dedicated policies like the Personal Conduct Policy and 
  the Proper Business Practice Policy, all integral components of our Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) project and incorporated in the updated 
  Corporate Governance Manual.</p>
<p>Implementation and oversight of the Code are a collaborative effort involving SEDCO’s Legal Department, the Corporate Communication and Sustainability Department, and the Human Resources Department, which manages staff training and communication. The Code is readily accessible to all employees, outlining their rights and providing clear procedures for raising concerns, including anonymous reporting via a dedicated email channel.</p>
<h2>Extending our Responsible Practices</h2>
<p>While the management teams of our portfolio companies are responsible for ethics and compliance oversight, SEDCO Holding conducts a top-level review for majority-owned entities, which complements management’s responsibilities. This includes self-assessments of Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) and Internal Audit charters, and ongoing compliance monitoring across SEDCO Holding and select affiliates.</p>
<p>We are currently in the process of developing a Whistleblowing Policy, which would further our efforts to develop a culture of ethical conduct, while also improving accountability and openness within the Company. The policy will include clear pathways to raise concerns or report incidents, and also set out robust processes to address and resolve the same.</p>
<p>SEDCO’s Quality Assurance and Improvement Program ensures ongoing evaluation. Internal assessments, conducted annually by department heads or qualified personnel, are complemented by external evaluations at least every five years by independent assessors. The Vice President of Internal Audit presents findings from both internal and external assessments to senior management and the Audit and Risk Committee (ARC).</p>
<h2>SHARIAH COMPLIANCE</h2>
<p>Recognizing the scale and complexity of SEDCO’s operations, the Board of Directors established a dedicated Shariah Committee in 2022. This committee oversees the Shariah governance framework and supervises all investment decisions.</p>
<p>In 2023, a Shariah compliance template was developed for implementation across our Corporate and Real Estate investment sectors. Adhering to Shariah principles, all potential investment opportunities require verification by Compliance in alignment with the Shariah Advisor, a member of the Shariah Committee, before proceeding.</p>
<p>To further strengthen Shariah compliance, the Legal Department established a dedicated Shariah Division. Comprising two legal team members, this division facilitates effective coordination and communication between the Shariah Committee and SEDCO Holding management.</p>
<p>2024, incorporating the Shariah Compliance template. 
  All third-party assessments are presented with investment opportunities or otherwise approved by the Shariah Advisor.</p>
