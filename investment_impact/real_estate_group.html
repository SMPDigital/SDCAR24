						<h1>Real Estate Group</h1>	
<p class="lifer">In 2024, SEDCO received approval to create, a new subsidiary that will oversee the three key pillars of our real estate portfolio: Investment, Development, and Asset Management. </p>
<p>Our current portfolio consists of a land bank (54%), built assets (28%), real estate private equity (15%) and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) through SEDCO’s shareholding in SEDCO Capital REIT. Within the built-assets portfolio, our hospitality sector holds a prominent position, followed by retail space, residential real estate, and other segments. Guided by a financial investor mindset, our real estate initiatives will focus on delivering strong shareholder returns.</p>
<p>[[Image]]</p>
<h2>From Strategy to Action</h2>
<p>In 2024, Real Estate Group secured approval for its FY23-27 Strategy and Business Plan to deliver a well-balanced portfolio. The strategy emphasizes sectorial and geographical diversification, with a focus on expanding into new asset classes, such as infrastructure, developing mixed-use projects on existing land bank and new acquisitions. </p>
<p>We are implementing a robust organizational framework to further empower our team to achieve the strategic objectives and deliver strong returns for our shareholders. In addition, we are exploring multiple funding sources, including the potential sale of non-core assets, to facilitate accelerated investment deployment and ensure the success of the strategic plan. </p>
<p>In 2023, our portfolio comprised 60% income-generating assets and 40% non-income generating assets. The strategic plan aims to prioritize increasing the income-generating portion to 77%, primarily through new developments and investments in high-growth sectors. Concurrently, the plan seeks to optimize existing income-generating assets by increasing NOI yields 
  from 5.0% to 6.4%.</p>
<p><img src="02-SDCAR24_Reviews-2_(English)-JA_Edited-web-resources/image/17.png" alt="" />&#9;In 2024, SEDCO achieved a 15% increase in recurring income, exceeding our budget by 5%. We divested five assets, including the successful receipt of compensation.</p>
<p>To streamline asset management and ensure VAT compliance, we introduced REIS, an in-house electronic platform, and integrated it with ZATCA.</p>

Furthermore, we successfully transitioned two assets to an income generating status.</p>

<h2>Real estate outlook for 2025</h2>
<p>In 2025, SEDCO will focus on the successful execution of initiatives and strategies currently in progress. We aim to engage with all PIF entities to explore potential collaborative investment opportunities. </p>
<p>Plans to subdivide and sell a 1,500,029 sqm plot in Umm 
  Al Joud, Makkah is underway. </p>
<p>The projects development in Jeddah, Madinah and Makkah will continue in 2025 to achieve Board Approval on the concept design and the overall development plans for mixed-use projects in Jeddah, achieve Building Permit and construction for the Gas station in Madinah and achieve approval of infrastructure design for Umm Al Joud land. </p>
<p>Renovation of two hospitality assets located in Jeddah and Makkah will commence in 2025 to upgrade both properties and enhance the revenue from these two assets.</p>
<p>In alignment with our strategy of divesting non-core holdings, we will continue the aggressive divestment of our international assets located in the UAE, Lebanon, 
  and Egypt.</p>
<p>SEDCO is in the process of developing an ESG policy and procedure. Renovations are underway at Al Nakheel Center in Jeddah, which will upgrade energy efficiency. Additionally, we have requested a roadmap for achieving LEED certification and WELL Building Standard compliance, across our properties.
