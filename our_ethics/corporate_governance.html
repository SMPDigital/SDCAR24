<p>To ensure accountability, strategic oversight, and open communication across operations, we have established specialized Board Committees that support our highest governing body in discharging their duties and responsibilities.

<h2>Functioning of the Board</h2>
<p>As part of our updated Corporate Governance Manual, we have established guidelines for Board competence, training, and assessment, which are vital for effective governance. These systems ensure board members possess the necessary skills and knowledge, maintain high performance standards, and align with evolving best practices and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Training for Board Members is tailored based on existing skills and capabilities, future needs, and expertise that Board Members would require at SEDCO’s affiliates. Additionally, we follow a standardised Board evaluation process, with routine effectiveness evaluations, which assesses the performance of the Board based on criteria outlined in the Company’s Corporate Governance Manual.</p>

<h2>Audit Cycle</h2>
<p>TeamMate+, a comprehensive audit management software, streamlines the IAD’s audit cycle. External Quality 
  Assurance (EQA) assessments, by the Institute of Internal Auditors (US IIA), are conducted every five years; 
  the most recent was in 2020.</p>
<p>[[Diagram]]</p>
<h2>ESG Governance</h2>
<p>SEDCO Holding’s ongoing review of its Corporate Governance Framework incorporates ESG factors and other material topics. These changes detail our commitments to Environmental, Social, and Governance pillars, and outline the Board and its committees’ 
  oversight of ESG matters.</p>
<p>Recognizing the pivotal role of ESG in our strategy, the Sustainability Council–comprised of SEDCO Holding members and representatives from affiliated organizations–collaborates with the Corporate Communications and Sustainability Team. This collaboration focuses on reviewing climate-related risks and opportunities, and assessing the potential ESG impacts of SEDCO Holding’s strategic roadmap. Our ESG strategy includes a continued commitment to reducing the environmental impact of our operations, particularly greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<h2>Risk Management</h2>
<p>SEDCO Holding operates in a complex and constantly evolving investment environment, where effective management of risk is a critical part of operations. We are in the process of developing a Risk Management (RM) Policy and a set of RM Procedures, which would guide our operations within approved risk tolerance levels. Plans are in place for activation of a dedicated RM function and implementation of the policy, in 2025. Development of RM Policies and Procedures are part of SEDCO’s company-wide review of policies and procedures (P&amp;P). </p>

<h2>OUR CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT</h2>
<p>SEDCO’s Code of Business Conduct is the cornerstone of our ethical culture, guiding employees at all levels in their daily operations. In 2024, SEDCO Holding conducted a training session for selected employees to enhance compliance awareness and knowledge. Our commitment to integrity and accountability is reflected in our outstanding track record, with no instances of 
  non-compliance reported during the year.</p>
<p>The Code mandates adherence to all applicable laws and regulations and addresses critical areas such as conflicts of interest, integrity, insider trading, gifts and entertainment, and anti-money laundering. It provides clear guidance on navigating ethical issues and offers confidential reporting channels for addressing unethical conduct internally. Applicable across all SEDCO activities, the Code extends to our suppliers, contractors, and consultants. An Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (AML/CTF) Policy, which includes a comprehensive screening process, is currently under development.</p>
<p>Integrated into our Corporate Governance framework and Human Resources policies, the Code is reinforced by dedicated policies like the Personal Conduct Policy and 
  the Proper Business Practice Policy, all integral components of our Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) project and incorporated in the updated 
  Corporate Governance Manual.</p>
<p>Implementation and oversight of the Code are a collaborative effort involving SEDCO’s Legal Department, the Corporate Communication and Sustainability Department, and the Human Resources Department, which manages staff training and communication. The Code is readily accessible to all employees, outlining their rights and providing clear procedures for raising concerns, including anonymous reporting via a dedicated email channel.</p>
<h2>EXTENDING OUR RESPONSIBLE PRACTICES</h2>
<p>While the management teams of our portfolio companies are responsible for ethics and compliance oversight, SEDCO Holding conducts a top-level review for majority-owned entities, which complements management’s responsibilities. This includes self-assessments of Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) and Internal Audit charters, and ongoing compliance monitoring across SEDCO Holding and select affiliates.</p>
<p>We are currently in the process of developing a Whistleblowing Policy, which would further our efforts to develop a culture of ethical conduct, while also improving accountability and openness within the Company. The policy will include clear pathways to raise concerns or report incidents, and also set out robust processes to address and resolve the same.</p>
<p>SEDCO’s Quality Assurance and Improvement Program ensures ongoing evaluation. Internal assessments, conducted annually by department heads or qualified personnel, are complemented by external evaluations at least every five years by independent assessors. The Vice President of Internal Audit presents findings from both internal and external assessments to senior management and the Audit and Risk Committee (ARC).</p>
<h2>SHARIAH COMPLIANCE</h2>
<p>Recognizing the scale and complexity of SEDCO’s operations, the Board of Directors established a dedicated Shariah Committee in 2022. This committee oversees the Shariah governance framework and supervises all investment decisions.</p>
<p>In 2023, a Shariah compliance template was developed for implementation across our Corporate and Real Estate investment sectors. Adhering to Shariah principles, all potential investment opportunities require verification by Compliance in alignment with the Shariah Advisor, a member of the Shariah Committee, before proceeding.</p>
<p>To further strengthen Shariah compliance, the Legal Department established a dedicated Shariah Division. Comprising two legal team members, this division facilitates effective coordination and communication between the Shariah Committee and SEDCO Holding management.</p>
<p>2024, incorporating the Shariah Compliance template. 
  All third-party assessments are presented with investment opportunities or otherwise approved by the Shariah Advisor.</p>
